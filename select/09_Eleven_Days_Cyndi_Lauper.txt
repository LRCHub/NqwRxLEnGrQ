He's so fast, tell me what's his name?
It was only a moment, but I don't feel the same

He gave me two roses
He gave me two roses
One is open
One is closed
One is the future
And one is my love

Eleven days since the moment we met
Eleven days I will never forget
Eleven diamonds on the ring that he gave
I haven't seen him in eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days

What am I doin'? Must be out of my mind
He pulled out the paper and I signed on the line

He gave me two roses
He gave me two roses
One is open
One is closed
One is the future
And one is my love
