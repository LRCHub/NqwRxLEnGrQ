This is not a dream
This is not a movie
The world that's surrounded
by the thick lies
The world that's surrounded
by the thick clouds
Someone has to end
Someday, it has to end
Chaos
Pain
Lie
Hate
Sadness
Jealous
Anger
Trap
Separation
Negativity
Loneliness
War
Abuse
Slander
Darkness
Tragedy
Violence
Evil
Sin
Denial
Envy
Crime
Rage
Someday we can achieve
the world without these
Someday we can achieve
the world
where everybody can smile
The darkest night
will still have a sunrise
Getting over these "nightmare"
