One day TV said
"Tomorrow is run of the mill"
What's my life? What's myself?
"It's your life" "Not so bad"
"I guess"
What do you think
looking up to moon light?
Let's paint the town red
What do you know? It is alright
Ok! Just do your best
What do you think
looking up to moon light?
Let's paint the town red
What do you know? It is alright
Ok! Just do your best
No! You're wrong "Time is up?"
No! You're wrong "All is lost"
But you cannot back out now
It's too late now
but do your best
Good luck my friend
"YOU CAN FLY AWAY"
Don't need trying to be a hero
Someday you can fly far away
Never say die  Don't let it go
Just do your best
Don't need trying to be a hero
Someday you can fly far away
Never say die  Don't let it go
Just do your best
＜♪＞
I got nothing, there is no sense
looking back all my past
Trying to find
big! big! treasure
It's just beyond the light
No! You're wrong "Time is up?"
No! You're wrong "All is lost"
But you cannot back out now
It's too late now
but do your best
Good luck my friend
"YOU CAN FLY AWAY"
Don't need trying to be a hero
Someday you can fly far away
Never say die  Don't let it go
Just do your best
Don't need trying to be a hero
Someday you can fly far away
Never say die  Don't let it go
Just do your best
