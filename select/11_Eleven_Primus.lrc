[01:03.71] I just can't seem to blend into society
[01:09.07] I have no hope for this dim simplicity of law and order
[01:21.44] By whose rules
[01:27.00] I see no rhyme in the reason
[01:33.67] I hold no hope for this holy treason of love and so soft
[01:45.46] By whose standards, by whose standards
[01:52.33] They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
[02:00.01] They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me
[02:03.86] Who are they, who is they?

[02:52.52] I just can't seem to fit into society
[02:58.07] I hold no hope for this dim simplicity of law and order
[03:10.61] By whose rules?
[03:16.76] I see no rhyme in the reason
[03:22.89] I hold no hope for this holy treason of love and so soft
[03:35.09] By whose standards, by my standards
[03:41.08] They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
[03:49.41] They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me
[03:53.53] Who are they, who is they?
