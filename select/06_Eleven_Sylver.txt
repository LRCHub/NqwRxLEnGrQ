Eleven...
You been waiting for a minute it's eleven on the dot
Shitty moments put behind me yeah i never really know what i'm doing till i do it i dont know i'm just made this way
How that moment really hit me in my mind you were immortal never really had a chance to see my vision in your view (eeh) guess thats all she wrote for you
Living breathing like i own it
How to fill these shoes you left me
Got tiny feet i'll go around it
To keep those moments so they dont fade
I hope you're watching from a clear view as your prodigies adopt you
And these numbers getting high though
Make you a grand dad soon too
Loyal bonds have been built too all for all how you taught it... we all ridin for eachother
Our biggest win if you adk me
Guess you're immortal in that way we'll keep it going for a lifetime and though these tears go a long way it's happy tears and in our way to keep your legacy alive through all these moments that we live throughwe pass it on to the next ones so they kow where we came from
I don't know about the future so i'll be living in the moment
(Oooh oooh oooh)

I wont pretend i know whats on the other side but the void you left is real something time just wont heal (oooh i)
I try but i'm so lost in foreign land tryna be a brother and a friend i do what i can to get even with the mark you left you live on these halls i call a heart
I hope you can tell i'm stronger its how its meant to be
Took me a while but finally the clock started moving again you're in a better place
You ohh you're in a better place oh
